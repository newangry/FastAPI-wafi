An index is the highest-level organizational unit of vector data in Pinecone. 
It accepts and stores vectors, serves queries over the vectors it contains, 
and does other vector operations over its contents. Each index runs on at least one pod.


You can create an index in the pinecone dashboard and I can create it in code.
I implemented this case in my previous code. If no index has been created, we implemented a function to create an index.
So, when there was an issue here, several indexes were created.

If compared to a data base, each index is equivalent to one database or storage. 
Therefore, if we create multiple indexes, the database and hardware capacity at pinecone increases, so we charge more.
